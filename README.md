##### *About me*
I have been interested in IT:computer: for the last year.
I have finished: 
```
-Riga Tech Girls
-She Goes Tech Java pre-bootcamp courses
-Acodemy.lv manual testing courses
```
I have willingness and desire to express myself in testing and continuing studying in the test automation, as well as to find a job in testing.

I have worked in different positions as a real estate agent, client relationship manager as well as I am a good teacher for my kids. All the time I try to continue learning new things. Testing is a new challenge for me. I would like to participate in real projects, work in team, thatâ€™s why edu.lu.lv is a great opportunity to combine the existing work and to study automation testing. I am going to prepare and pass [ISTQB](https://astqb.org/) **foundation level**. I am ready to start as intern and continue growing in testing. 

My previous positions afforded me a well-rounded skill set, including good relationship building.

I am good at outlining project scope, managing timeline and deadlines, reporting on overall progress, respect the difference in cross-cultural team.

**Speaking about my hobbies.**

I like spending my time with my family:family_man_woman_boy_boy:. We like travelling:world_map:, hiking in wood or mountains.

Also I like reading psychology books, gardening. My favourite season is spring, when everything starts to bloom.
